    """Performs testing of term based RST injection over a set

    large sets of terms while still being able to identify
    which specific terms are leading to blocking.

    Usually this test should be run with a larger list of uncensored
    terms in order to identify newly censored terms. If this
    test is passed a list that mainly contains censored words it
    will end up doing more work than if each word were tested
    individually.

    This test sends a raw TCP packet with possibly blocked
    keywords within it. As such, keyword based detection that
    checks for keywords at a specific point in the connection
    (e.g. after a handshake), within a specific type of request
    (e.g. during a GET request) will not be detected.

    Initial RST term matching enumeration testing should be
    conducted with a known filtered term to identify the places
    and conditions under which term matching occurs. Once that
    has been identified this test can be modified to test against
    the conditions identified.
